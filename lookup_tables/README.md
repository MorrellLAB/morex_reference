# Lookup Tables

`BOPA_lookup.txt`
Li Lei generated `BOPA_lookup.txt` and had to do quite a bit of work on the raw data. The original data was downloaded from Close T. J., Bhat P. R., Lonardi S., Wu Y., Rostoks N., et al., 2009. Development and implementation of high-throughput SNP genotyping in barley. BMC Genomics 10: 582. But the names of the SNPs were a big mess, so Li had to rename them to create the lookup table. Li Lei originally created `BOPA_lookup.txt` in `/panfs/roc/groups/9/morrellp/llei/Deleterious_mutation_project/BOPA_POPA_remap_refv1/raw/BOPA_lookup.txt`. Chaochih Liu copied it into this directory to make the file easier to find.

`9k_lookup.txt`
Li Lei downloaded this file directly into `/panfs/roc/groups/9/morrellp/shared/Datasets/Genotyping/9k_BOPA_POPA_refv1.0/9k_iselect`. Chaochih Liu copied it from `/panfs/roc/groups/9/morrellp/shared/Datasets/Genotyping/9k_BOPA_POPA_refv1.0/9k_iselect/Lookup.txt` to this directory and renamed it to 9k_lookup.txt so it is easier to find all the lookup tables.
