# Morex v3

This directory contains scripts and submodules for file processing/creation that are necessary for using the reference genome.

Morex v3 reference genome can be accessed through e!DAL - Plant Genomics & Phenomics Research Data Repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5447/ipk/2021/3

## Step 1: Prepare Reference

Run scripts in `prep_reference` subdirectory to get reference genome ready for downstream use. See readme in subdirectory for detailed documentation.

## Step 2: Get Morex v3 BOPA, 9K, and 50K positions

Run scripts in `50k_9k_BOPA_SNP` subdirectory. See readme in subdirectory for detailed documentation.
